> translated by [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/)

### Overall Objective

The overall objective of implementing this plan is to understand
the current structure and situation of the labor force and its
changes. This objective is achieved through "seasonal and annual
estimation of labor force indicators", "annual estimation of
numbers at the national and provincial levels", "estimation of
seasonal and annual changes in labor force indicators at the
national level", and "estimation of annual changes in labor force
indicators at the provincial level".

### Target Population

The target population comprises individuals who, by definition, are
members of normal resident or group households in urban or rural
areas of the country. This plan does not cover members of
non-resident normal households or institutional households.

### Reference Period

The reference period for measuring "employment", "unemployment in
terms of lack of work" and in general "activity status of the
individual", is the second and third calendar week (Saturday to
Friday) of the middle month of each season, called the "reference
week".

The reference period for measuring "unemployment in terms of
readiness for work" is two weeks, including the reference week and
one week after that.

The reference period for measuring "unemployment in terms of job
search" is four weeks, including the reference week and three weeks
before that.

The reference period for measuring "migration" is the past 12
months leading up to the time of data collection.

The reference period for measuring "usual hours worked per week" is
the survey calendar quarter.

### Data Collection Period

The data collection period in each season is the third calendar
week of the middle month and the following week, i.e. the week
after the reference week. That is, if the household is visited in
the third calendar week of the month, the questionnaires will be
completed with the second calendar week as the reference week. And
if the household is visited in the fourth week of the month, the
third week of the month will be considered as the reference week.

### Data Collection Method

The data collection method in this plan is sampling.

### Data Gathering Method

In this survey, information is collected through interviewing. In
this way, the surveyor completes the household questionnaire by
interviewing the most informed member of the household and the
individual questionnaire by interviewing each household member aged
10 years and above.

### Sampling Method

The sampling method is two-stage stratified cluster sampling, where
the primary sampling unit is the cluster and the secondary sampling
unit is a group consisting of three mostly adjacent households
(rotation group).

In addition to estimating levels, estimating changes is also of 
interest in this plan. Therefore, a rotational sampling method is 
used. Rotational sampling, by keeping part of the sample units 
constant between two survey rounds and changing the rest, provides 
the best possibility to estimate both levels and changes. Proper 
implementation of rotational sampling requires the use of a master 
sample. The master sample refers to a sample from which subsamples 
for meeting the needs of several surveys or several rounds of a 
survey can be selected. In periodic surveys, using a master sample, 
in addition to economic efficiency, allows better control of 
operational activities and overlap of samples in different rounds.

### Master Sample Frame and Design

The primary sampling frame in this plan is the fourth master sample 
of household surveys, which includes the primary sampling units 
(clusters). Each cluster includes one block/village, part of a large 
block/village or in some cases a set of several small blocks/villages, 
which is constructed based on the information from the 2016 general 
population and housing census to provide sample households for labor 
force surveys over the master sample period.

The secondary sampling frame is a list of names and addresses of 
normal resident and group households in the selected clusters from 
the master sample. The method of constructing this framework is 
different in urban and rural areas.

In urban areas, to construct this framework, resident households 
within a specified geographical area are listed in each cluster 
before implementing the plan. The geographical areas related to 
each year are identified based on information obtained from the 
2016 general population and housing census in a way that includes 
the intended number of normal resident and group households in that 
year. New households introduced each year are selected based on the 
listing conducted in the last months of the previous year.

In rural areas, the secondary sampling frame is obtained from two 
sources. This framework in most rural areas includes a list of 
households in the relevant clusters based on listing forms from 
the 2016 general population and housing census. In a small number 
of rural clusters, this framework was obtained through listing 
operations in December 2017.

### Rotation Pattern

Given the objectives of the plan, the selective rotation pattern 
for this plan is a "2-2-2 pattern", which means that during the 
master sample period, each sample household is surveyed a maximum 
of four times, so that the household is in the sample for two 
consecutive seasons, then is temporarily out of the sample for two 
consecutive seasons, then re-enters the sample for two consecutive 
seasons, and after that is out of the sample until the end of the 
years related to the master sample period. In each season, in each 
cluster, four rotation groups each consisting of three mostly adjacent 
households are surveyed:

1. A group that has entered the sample for the first time,
1. A group that is in the sample for the second time,
1. A group that has re-entered the sample after two seasons of temporary departure,
1. A group that is in the sample for the last time.

In this way, the maximum overlap between two consecutive seasons and 
two identical seasons from two consecutive years is 50%, and between 
two consecutive years is 55%, which can meet the objectives of the plan.

After constructing the rotation groups, based on the rotation 
pattern, four rotation groups are assigned to each survey round 
for all their member households to be surveyed. In this way, in 
each survey round, twelve households in each cluster are visited.
